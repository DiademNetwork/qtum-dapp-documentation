## What is Diadem Network?

Diadem Network leverages blockchain technology from [Qtum](https://qtum.org) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)  

On Diadem network you can be an achiever and/or a sponsor.

**Achiever**:  
Fighting for the planet? Helping people out? But you need a boost?  
Get financial support using Diadem Network:  

1. Publish a Facebook post explaining your achievement (with text, picture(s), video(s)).  
2. **CREATE YOUR ACHIEVEMENT** on Diadem Network with the link to your Facebook post.  
3. **WITHDRAW** QTUM tokens you receive from others supporting your great actions!  

Note you can **UPDATE YOUR ACHIEVEMENT** if it evolves. Available only if you created one.

**Sponsor**:  
You want to financially support people helping the world?  

- **CONFIRM** achievements you know are real.  
- You want to give immediate **SUPPORT** ? You can send QTUM tokens right away.  
- You prefer waiting for someone you choose to confirm the achievement ? Then **DEPOSIT** QTUM tokens. They will not be transferred until he does.  

Note about application usage:  
- Facebook Login is required to perform most actions.  
- A hot wallet is used to manage QTUM transactions.  
- Creating, Updating and Confirming achievements are free.  
- Supporting, Depositing and Withdrawing require QTUM tokens.  
- [Check official QTUM user guide here](https://docs.qtum.site/en/) to know how to send QTUM tokens to yourself.

## Roadmap

- September 2018: Release of Proof of Concept mainnet version for QTUM Hackathon

- November/December 2018: Preparing next version release for Q1 2019, with features based on feedbacks.
- 2019: TBD

## Future improvement ideas (waiting for real usage feedbacks)

- Internationalize platform, so anyone in the world can participate
- Add other types of achievements (self-goal-achievement, group achievement, one-time/running achievement...) and their custom rules
- Add categories for achievements (art, society, education, ecology...)
- Add filters (by date, by category, by confirmations count....) for achievements on platform.
- Add search function to find achievement(s) (search by title, creator...)
- Make it possible to choose a group of witnesses for deposit, with configurable rules (all must confirm / half must confirm ?)
- Integrate Diadem Network with other social networks (Twitter, Google+, Medium...)
- Improve fee management in hot wallet (so users can chose fees they are willing to spend, to make blockchain confirmations faster)
- Add possibility to report an achievement (for example if someone post something non-ethical)
- Or add administrator users to filter achievements at creation time ? => To be discussed
- Add possibility to delete his achievement(s)
- Make it possible to create more than one achievement per user
- Integrate with Qrypto (or equivalent) if user prefer to use it instead of DM Hot wallet
