## What is Diadem Network?

Diadem Network aims to connect users achieving great things with people wanting to support them

Actions you can do on Diadem Network:  

- CREATE YOUR ACHIEVEMENT (1max per user): Post a link to an achievement you already posted on facebook
- UPDATE YOUR ACHIEVEMENT: Your achievement evolved? No problem! Available only if you have an achievement created
- CONFIRM achievement(s): Confirm other user(s) achievement(s)
- SUPPORT achievement(s): Send QTUM token to achievers to show them some love
- DEPOSIT for achievement(s): Deposit QTUM tokens which will not be sent until the facebook user YOU chose confirms the achievement
- WITHDRAW your tokens: QTUM Tokens you own in your hot wallet can be withdrawn any time you want

General information about usage:  

- Facebook Login is required to perform most actions
- A hot wallet is used to manage QTUM transactions
- Create, Update and Confirm are free
- Support, Deposit and Withdraw need QTUM tokens. For this, you must send some to your hot wallet

## Future improvement ideas

- Internationalize platform, so anyone in the world can participate
- Add categories for achievements (art, society, education...)
- Add filters (by date, by category, by confirmations count....) for achievements on platform.
- Make it possible to choose a group of witnesses for deposits
- Integrate Diadem Network with other social networks (Twitter, Google+, Medium...)
- Improve fee management in hot wallet (so users can chose fees they want to send)
- Make it possible to create an achievement done by multiple persons (and chose supports distribution rules)
- Add possibility to report an achievement (for example if someone post something non-ethical)
- Add possibility to delete his achievement(s)
- Make to possible to create more than one achievement per user
- Integrate with Qrypto (or equivalent) if user prefer to use it instead of DM Hot wallet
